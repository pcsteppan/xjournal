# xjournal

## Summary
X Journal is a visual arts publication at Knox College.
This repository is the journal's website, which hosts all the artwork and essays published in the journal.

## Technical Information
The site uses Vue for its structure, routing, and seamless page rendering.
I used Tachyons for styling and CSS Grid for responsive layout.
I had no need for a full backend. So the site and images are hosted through Netlify, and the data is generated as JSON from a spreadsheet.

## History
I've been developing this site as a side project since 2018.
It has been a good opportunity and project to help me learn about responsive design, UI, web-typography, all in general and in regards to accessibiliy, and VueJS.
