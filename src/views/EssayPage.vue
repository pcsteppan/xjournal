Come Away With</h1>

        >What are we doing when we look at a piece of art? This question might appear pointless at first glance. Haven’t I already said it? Art is for looking at. But aren’t there different ways of looking at images? Do different people look in different ways? For most of us, vision forms our most basic attachment to the world, something that we can’t turn off without a conscious effort. But that doesn’t mean that the things in your visual field are reducible to your automatic recognition of them. There’s no such thing as a “neutral” way of looking at an image. Sure, visual phenomena are more or less the same for all of us in their likeness, but there’s more to the equation than that. Wherever there’s a looking-at, there’s also a looking-for. Our expectations and assumptions about what we’re seeing have as much to do with the experience viewers come away with as the art itself. And I’m not just talking about the difference between someone who knows how the chiaroscuro in a painting was done and someone who doesn’t. Certainly, there’s a lot of art out there that’s aimed at what we might call an educated audience, but, when it comes down to the basic experience of checking out something you’ve never seen before, there’s a lot that stands to color what we take away from it: our background, our tastes, our moods, visual acuity, and, yes, prior experience with visual arts. Our relation to visual perception is conditional to all of these things. And that’s just what it does in the context of art.</p>

        >First and foremost, vision acts as a tool to help us function. It always has. Science itself, after all, is based on observation. For this reason, vision is intimately tied up with the way we construct and verify knowledge. “I’ll believe it when I see it.” Implicit in this phrase is a particular kind of looking: a looking-for truth, if you will. When we use this expression, we’re lending vision a certain authority to determine the reality of the things in front of us. In this way, science has established a longstanding visual legacy that remains embedded in popular conceptions of vision. However, this is not all that vision can be for us, but merely one of its modes. If science puts vision toward the purposes of knowledge or truth, art asks of us an appreciation of what we perceive. But even here, there are tnuances and complications. Our collective ways of seeing have, to some extent, a shared history that can’t be easily separated into visions of science and art. There was a time, for instance, that the most revered works of art were those that mapped themselves on to a mathematical grid, even if this would give way, a few centuries later, to a period in which vibrant color usurped linear precision as an important element of compelling art. Regardless of the specific values of today’s art crowd, we navigate these conditioned modes of perception every time a new sight catches our eye.</p>

        >But let’s get back to talking about works of art and our firsthand encounters with them. Consider your experience perusing the different pieces on display in a gallery. There’s a sense in which everything there simply waits for our consumption as viewers. Most of us don’t hit the museums every day, so when we get the chance, we tend to march through each exhibit with a rare gusto. The experience of walking through the museum, hungrily ogling works of art, is all too common, but perhaps we should also consider that artworks can present a challenge to their viewers rather than waiting passively for our gawking looks. To be sure, works of art are often deeply personal for their creators, but, at the same time, the creative decisions artists make are also intended to engage certain visual possibilities for an audience, to bring out a certain kind of looking that unearths the full potential of an artwork. When we say that artists have a “vision” they need to share with us, we can take that idea literally; the artist, being struck by a particular point of view or a novel sort of looking, creates something that allows others to adopt a similar vantage point. An artist’s first inspiration is bound to be a wondrous sight unknowingly stumbled upon, be it a polished artwork or a natural spectacle, and so we can say of art that it, if nothing else, offers an earnest tribute to the incomparable character of human visuality.</p>

        >This brings me, finally, to the name of the journal you’re currently holding: X. Why would a visual arts journal name itself after a letter, an object of language arts, which sit at a far remove from the visual creations we’ve been concerned with thus far? The figure “X” grounds itself, however, in a variety of different types of communication. “X” can be taken an allusion to written language, but it also functions as iconography, a pictorial emblem that bears an independent importance. Although “X,” as an alphabetical character, relies upon accompanying signs and related ideas to convey meaning, as an icon it can be a meaningful symbol on its own, denoting completion or rejection without a grammatical system. In this way, “X” is bilingual. It straddles two unique methods of expression. These languages are similar, however, in their reliance upon the viewer. All languages, symbolic or pictorial, lie in wait for a viewing subject to animate them. Without our look, the meaning within symbols remains unrealized and dormant. Moreover, the dual nature of “X” urges us to look for visual intrigue where we least expect it, transitioning seamlessly from a senseless cog in a linguistic system to an icon with an independent meaning. In the same way that the “X” is defined by a point of intersection, its malleability as a symbol illustrates the pivotal importance of the viewer’s encounter with the work of art.</p>

        >In this sense, “X” can be taken as a call for us to seek out new forms of expression that shirk the conventional forms of visual arts. We talk a lot about the celebration of “low art” as a new area of visual exploration. The dissolution of the high/ low distinction, as a cultural event, gave us license to apply an appreciative look to objects that don’t normally attract more than a banal glance. Naturally, we approach urinals like the one used in Duchamp’s exposition with certain expectations, but aesthetic fascination usually isn’t one of them. That changed with the readymade, and we should note that the principle change wasn’t in the works of art presented, but in the way in which we collectively approach visual objects. The types of looks we deploy in different moments depend on cultural ways of looking that can change with new artistic experiments. As the readymade attests, the true goal of a work of art often consists not just in the awe it elicits with its first impression, but with the new visual outlook it imparts to the viewer after they’ve left the gallery.</p>

        >As a closing thought, I’d like to consider the images enclosed in this journal and the types of looks we might bring to bear as readers. As members of the Knox community, we might look through the book with a special affection, relishing the talent of our classmates. At the same time, holding the book physically in hand might turn the thing into a “page-turner,” as we feverishly rifle through the pages with a greedy desire to run our eyes over the entire collection in an instant. I would propose, however, a different kind of look. Instead of simply searching for your friends, try looking at these pieces slowly, letting them suggest a way of looking through their visual form. Rather than recognizing a name, look to understand the visual inspirations that drew the artist to create. Our contributing artists have given us a profound collection of works, but they cannot be actualized without our loving scrutiny. And so, I invite you to examine these artworks with an attitude of patience and curiosity. Much like our eponymous “X,” they might contain more than you expect.</p>
