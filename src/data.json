        "What are we doing when we look at a piece of art? This question might appear pointless at first glance. Haven’t I already said it? Art is for looking at. But aren’t there different ways of looking at images? Do different people look in different ways? For most of us, vision forms our most basic attachment to the world, something that we can’t turn off without a conscious effort. But that doesn’t mean that the things in your visual field are reducible to your automatic recognition of them. There’s no such thing as a “neutral” way of looking at an image. Sure, visual phenomena are more or less the same for all of us in their likeness, but there’s more to the equation than that. Wherever there’s a looking-at, there’s also a looking-for. Our expectations and assumptions about what we’re seeing have as much to do with the experience viewers come away with as the art itself. And I’m not just talking about the difference between someone who knows how the chiaroscuro in a painting was done and someone who doesn’t. Certainly, there’s a lot of art out there that’s aimed at what we might call an educated audience, but, when it comes down to the basic experience of checking out something you’ve never seen before, there’s a lot that stands to color what we take away from it: our background, our tastes, our moods, visual acuity, and, yes, prior experience with visual arts. Our relation to visual perception is conditional to all of these things. And that’s just what it does in the context of art.",
        "First and foremost, vision acts as a tool to help us function. It always has. Science itself, after all, is based on observation. For this reason, vision is intimately tied up with the way we construct and verify knowledge. “I’ll believe it when I see it.” Implicit in this phrase is a particular kind of looking: a looking-for truth, if you will. When we use this expression, we’re lending vision a certain authority to determine the reality of the things in front of us. In this way, science has established a longstanding visual legacy that remains embedded in popular conceptions of vision. However, this is not all that vision can be for us, but merely one of its modes. If science puts vision toward the purposes of knowledge or truth, art asks of us an appreciation of what we perceive. But even here, there are tnuances and complications. Our collective ways of seeing have, to some extent, a shared history that can’t be easily separated into visions of science and art. There was a time, for instance, that the most revered works of art were those that mapped themselves on to a mathematical grid, even if this would give way, a few centuries later, to a period in which vibrant color usurped linear precision as an important element of compelling art. Regardless of the specific values of today’s art crowd, we navigate these conditioned modes of perception every time a new sight catches our eye.",
        "But let’s get back to talking about works of art and our firsthand encounters with them. Consider your experience perusing the different pieces on display in a gallery. There’s a sense in which everything there simply waits for our consumption as viewers. Most of us don’t hit the museums every day, so when we get the chance, we tend to march through each exhibit with a rare gusto. The experience of walking through the museum, hungrily ogling works of art, is all too common, but perhaps we should also consider that artworks can present a challenge to their viewers rather than waiting passively for our gawking looks. To be sure, works of art are often deeply personal for their creators, but, at the same time, the creative decisions artists make are also intended to engage certain visual possibilities for an audience, to bring out a certain kind of looking that unearths the full potential of an artwork. When we say that artists have a “vision” they need to share with us, we can take that idea literally; the artist, being struck by a particular point of view or a novel sort of looking, creates something that allows others to adopt a similar vantage point. An artist’s first inspiration is bound to be a wondrous sight unknowingly stumbled upon, be it a polished artwork or a natural spectacle, and so we can say of art that it, if nothing else, offers an earnest tribute to the incomparable character of human visuality.",
        "This brings me, finally, to the name of the journal you’re currently holding: X. Why would a visual arts journal name itself after a letter, an object of language arts, which sit at a far remove from the visual creations we’ve been concerned with thus far? The figure “X” grounds itself, however, in a variety of different types of communication. “X” can be taken an allusion to written language, but it also functions as iconography, a pictorial emblem that bears an independent importance. Although “X,” as an alphabetical character, relies upon accompanying signs and related ideas to convey meaning, as an icon it can be a meaningful symbol on its own, denoting completion or rejection without a grammatical system. In this way, “X” is bilingual. It straddles two unique methods of expression. These languages are similar, however, in their reliance upon the viewer. All languages, symbolic or pictorial, lie in wait for a viewing subject to animate them. Without our look, the meaning within symbols remains unrealized and dormant. Moreover, the dual nature of “X” urges us to look for visual intrigue where we least expect it, transitioning seamlessly from a senseless cog in a linguistic system to an icon with an independent meaning. In the same way that the “X” is defined by a point of intersection, its malleability as a symbol illustrates the pivotal importance of the viewer’s encounter with the work of art.",
        "In this sense, “X” can be taken as a call for us to seek out new forms of expression that shirk the conventional forms of visual arts. We talk a lot about the celebration of “low art” as a new area of visual exploration. The dissolution of the high/ low distinction, as a cultural event, gave us license to apply an appreciative look to objects that don’t normally attract more than a banal glance. Naturally, we approach urinals like the one used in Duchamp’s exposition with certain expectations, but aesthetic fascination usually isn’t one of them. That changed with the readymade, and we should note that the principle change wasn’t in the works of art presented, but in the way in which we collectively approach visual objects. The types of looks we deploy in different moments depend on cultural ways of looking that can change with new artistic experiments. As the readymade attests, the true goal of a work of art often consists not just in the awe it elicits with its first impression, but with the new visual outlook it imparts to the viewer after they’ve left the gallery.",
        "As a closing thought, I’d like to consider the images enclosed in this journal and the types of looks we might bring to bear as readers. As members of the Knox community, we might look through the book with a special affection, relishing the talent of our classmates. At the same time, holding the book physically in hand might turn the thing into a “page-turner,” as we feverishly rifle through the pages with a greedy desire to run our eyes over the entire collection in an instant. I would propose, however, a different kind of look. Instead of simply searching for your friends, try looking at these pieces slowly, letting them suggest a way of looking through their visual form. Rather than recognizing a name, look to understand the visual inspirations that drew the artist to create. Our contributing artists have given us a profound collection of works, but they cannot be actualized without our loving scrutiny. And so, I invite you to examine these artworks with an attitude of patience and curiosity. Much like our eponymous “X,” they might contain more than you expect."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Distortion is the altering of recognizable form for greater emphasis or intensity. Although often seen as a hallmark of modernity when artists decided to move away from “stifling” naturalism, distortion can be seen in artworks throughout history as artists grapple with the impossibility of fully depicting the experienced world. Whether done for informative, aesthetic, or emotional reasons, distortion persisted throughout the history of artistic expression because it offers an experience beyond our everyday physical reality. As distortion becomes more apparent in traditions of modern and contemporary art and in mass visual culture, we are more aware of the presence of distortion, but we must also become more discerning about the function of distortion within our diverse and dynamic modern visual landscapes.",
        "Even beginning with some of the earliest art discovered, humans were distorting their reproductions of the visual world with intent. The carved stone figurine of a woman with exaggerated breasts and hips and a simplified geometric pubic triangle called the Venus of Willendorf dates from approximately 28,000 BCE. This tiny ancient figure establishes a basis for two main means of distortion throughout history: exaggeration and simplification. Exaggeration magnifies an aspect of the subject matter, while simplification reduces details or embellishments of a feature to a more basic form. Although seemingly opposite, both of these forms of distortion depict the subject differently than it appears in reality in order to draw attention to the distorted area and create a new experience of the body, object, environment, or feeling.  Venus of Willendorf’s distortions are purposeful choices to emphasize the body parts important for fertility, leading scholars to speculate that she was used a fertility totem. The distortions of the fertile female body would have been similarly informative for the users and viewers in the past, perhaps prompting contemplation or rituals related to fertility.",
        "The same distortion can be seen in the works of the ancient Greeks and Romans. While celebrated for its naturalism, the distortion lies in the exaggerated perfection of the bodies depicted. Like the original Photoshop, the idealized bodies of gods and goddesses are ideally proportioned, muscled, and symmetric in order to reveal the divinity of the subject and reflect the fantasy of the ideal. Early Christian and medieval art distort for increased narrative clarity. Hierarchy of scale (enlarging the most important figures in an artwork) was used frequently to signify the dominating power of God.  The medieval depictions of baby Jesus with a receding hairline and forehead wrinkles establish Jesus’s identity not only as the Son of God, but as God himself, ancient and wise. In a time when the vast majority of citizens were not literate, religious art functioned as a visual Bible and had to be accessible and understandable to the masses at first glance. The informative distortion of figures clarifies meaning and tells the story without the need for reading.",
        "Artists after the Renaissance and during the Counter-Reformation often elongate and distort figures or dramatize a setting in order to express and ignite spiritual ecstasy. This dramatic distortion was used to create more expressive artworks to try to win back people to the Catholic Church after the Protestant Reformation. Later, Romanticism distorts through the expressive breaking of the Classical form as a rejection of the Enlightenment era concepts of empirical rationality. Romantic artists disparage the rationality that gave rise to chaos and disjunction of society evidenced by the rise of revolutions in politics and industry as working-class citizens demanded greater rights and representation. Artists continue to grapple with rapid changes to society seen as works become more obviously disjointed in the 20th century. The cubists radically distort through the breaking of the figure and space as they encounter new shifts in artistic and scientific thought. Building off of previous artists who attempted to depict the world as it was seen by the human eye, and taking in Einstein’s theories on spacetime and relativity that describe the relative fluidity of time and perception, the cubists challenge the traditional artistic paradigm of one-point perspective perfected during the Renaissance and instead use distortion and fragmentation of the subject to depict multiple perspectives and moments in time simultaneously. Artists working around WWI and WWII confront the physical and psychological destruction of the war through distortion in art, such as the eerily impossible imagined spaces and bodies of figurative surrealists who reflect on the irrationality of the unconscious mind. Dada and Surrealist collages cut and tear materials in order to be synthesized either by the hand of the artist or by chance, often in a way which emphasizes the violence of its creation. For artists of the early 20th century, distortion and destruction become a paradoxical visual language which can describe artistic and scientific innovation as well as critique the rationality and “progress” which only caused senseless violence and societal disintegration.",
        "In contemporary art, there is a trend of increasingly nonfigurative works which engages with artistic trends of distortion through exaggeration and simplification. By distancing art from the natural world, there is greater expressive freedom to focus purely on formal aspects of art.  This causes the question of distortion to become more challenging; when does an artwork stop being distorted and when does it just become nonfigurative abstraction? Can art exist as an aesthetic object without the connotations of recognizable subject matter? As aesthetic traits, distortion engages and excites the viewer by challenging us to grapple with an artwork without an immediately clear subject matter. Rather than identifying and responding to iconography using previous knowledge of the physical world, nonfigurative art relies on the formal power of color and form to evoke a response. This extreme form of distortion expands the realm of the artwork beyond our experienced physical reality so that distortion is no longer a tool for emphasizing an aspect of a depicted subject, but the distortion becomes itself the subject. ",
        "This challenges the idea of distortion itself. Distortion assumes a singular normative reality which is socially defined and static. When something is distorted, it means that it is abnormal, for the original subject is somehow twisted or altered. Without the expectation of normal, we couldn’t recognize the abnormal. It is no coincidence that more extreme distortion in art coincides with increasing awareness of diversity in society. Increasingly, limiting concepts of “normalcy” are identified and pushed back against through exposure to different people and societies via globalized media. Distortion engages the “abnormal” in order to draw attention to the inadequacy of a singular model to represent the diversity of our modern world. The act of recognizing distortion in art can question the assumption of normalcy and push the boundaries of represented reality. Like a mask, the normative narrative presents only one unchanging face and conceals the more dynamic and diverse reality underneath. Distortion can change the mask presented in order to catch our attention and get us to stop and question what is hidden beneath. When we peek at the less shiny but truer reality underneath we can recognize and relate to the abnormal, the messy, and the anomalous within ourselves and grapple with the intricacies of a more diverse world.",
        "Because of the urbanized, consumerist, globalized, and diverse reality we inhabit, we are experts at unifying disparate bits of information. Every day, we take in huge sums of information via social and traditional media which connect people and events around the world, creating an inevitable disjunction between conflicting and changing narratives. As consumers of global media, we have learned our own unique ways for synthesizing our dynamic world into a coherent understanding of reality. When approaching distortion, the first step is stopping long enough to recognize what is distorted. Sometimes this is easier said than done. Subtle distortion like advertising and social media may appear to reflect reality, but the distorted narrative often conceals the truth. Advertisements and social media distort in order to attract our attention and appeal to our consumerist desires through the exploitation of a singular idealized reality which can only be attained through the purchase of goods.  As more and more of our mental landscape is filtered through screens deploying these subtly distorted normative narratives, it can become more challenging to distinguish between what is “real” and “fake,” a dichotomy which is often manipulated or ignored. Rather than passively absorbing, we must ask what do I see and why? Distortion can challenge us to question the original idea of a unified whole. If what we see now is different, how? And more importantly, why? By not depicting the naturalistic whole, what is being said about the subject?",
        "The current generation of artists highlighted in this journal share this dynamic world and continue to engage with humanity’s relationship to reality, just as artists have done throughout the history of human expression. Rather than the defined and regulated methods of distortion common in earlier artistic periods, contemporary artists encounter and respond with greater personal liberty to a diverse and fluid global reality. Distortion confronts the myth of a normative reality by depicting reality filtered through the minds of the artist as well as the viewer. Art invites the viewer into a dialogue with the artist, the artwork, and the subject. You only need to take a walk through WAC to see this in action. While an entire painting class might be looking at the same still life, everyone’s works will vary greatly – bright or muted color, geometric or organic shapes, thick or thin paint, it is clear that the “real” subject matter of the still life is being distorted through the dialogue between the subject and the artist who brings their unique experience of “abnormalities” into their work. As viewers, when we enter into this dialogue, we bring with us our own unique background and perception of reality. Distortion’s shifting relationship with reality facilitates contemplation of the dynamic conversation between art, artists, history, society, and ourselves. In this disjunction of perspectives, we can connect and create in a new way, bringing in our diverse backgrounds and experiences to foster a novel discussion of art and the world around us."

        "I asked some friends what they felt when they heard the word “interruption.” One of them instantly described being interrupted, how it feels so belittling when someone cuts you off. Another described a mood change, or being taken aback. Someone mentioned seeing something you didn’t see before.",
        "This issue of X Journal seeks to explore the ways our current contentions with a variety of social, political, and personal forms of disquieting interruption manifest in diverse forms of visual expression. As this essay will examine, (western) art has traditionally been used to counter the disturbing force of interruption with forms that promise a sense of either rational order or spiritual tranquility. With the rise of modernity, accompanied by revolutionary social and political change, came radical art movements asking individuals to confront conflict and uncertainty. Artworks created by Knox students over the past year follow this trend and represent creativity as a form of critical response, communication, and revelation.",
        "Most of us understand interruptions as irritating, as disruptive to our normal routines and practices. We avoid them at all costs. Most recently, the global pandemic halted all normal relations. Some of us paused lifelong projects, others delayed weddings, and some didn't leave the house for over a year. We experienced violent interruptions: a car being driven through a group of protesters. Then there were daily, aching moments: pausing the mourning of a loved one to work a 9 to 5, or vice versa. Emotionally and physically, it’s hard to convey the true impact of these disruptions.",
        "Although now we universally feel the closeness of interruptions, they have always existed. For some more than others. We can see through the art historical lens how western civilizations have handled personal and social interruptions. In general, despite an ever-changing global landscape, western powers sought to maintain some semblance of cultural continuity. There’s always been a conservative force striving to streamline aesthetics and culture. When social or political disturbances occur, art is an anchor, a reflection of underlying values and social stability. Order. Predictability. The western world responded (and continues to respond) to aesthetic, celestial, and philosophical interruptions with a conservative reinstatement of traditional values.",
        "We can begin with the classical aesthetic forms of the Greeks and Romans, as most people do. They privileged Beauty above all else. Through idealized sculptures and busts, they sought to portray a society devoid of physical imperfections, thus implying their ethical and intellectual “superiority” as well. Although civilization was rapidly progressing and demanding different kinds of governance, there was a persisting desire to stabilize cultural values and maintain a sense of continuity. The beautiful, strong, convicted Augustus, and the wrinkled but profound features of the senators, are staples of western culture. Despite political turmoil–including the rise and fall of various cities–the Greeks and Romans were determined to maintain a visual and cultural projection.",
        "This desire for control extends to the intense spiritual awakening that defined the Medieval ages. The convolution of political and religious power was becoming confusing. Contemplating celestial realities while still trying to grasp earthly systems was (and is) unbalancing. In an attempt to make sense of their quickly expanding realities, church-employed artists created easily digestible and recognizable images of religious icons. Aesthetically, forms may vary, but they share an element of approachability. The figures are human enough to be safe, but still clearly transcendent. There was now a visual system ascribed to the heavenly. Medieval art was also plastered on walls, manuscripts, windows–places of comfort and access. The spiritual experience cannot be contained or defined; it can be quite overwhelming to consider what is greater than us. But, somehow, western leaders were able to create a visual language for the sake of control and continuity.",
        "Then we approach the Renaissance. Even during a period of transformative learning, western culture is again committed to the classical values of Beauty and secularism. The diverse intellectuality of Renaissance thinkers was supposedly a testament to the superior understanding of man and his world. Harmony and balance. Something that the Greeks and Romans invented and the western man inevitably continues. There was no human experience that couldn’t be defined by philosophy, no movement that couldn’t be depicted and recorded. Everything had an explanation. No matter what turmoil, spiritual or political, that may surface, there exists a continuous set of values that westerners apparently adhere to.",
        "After a few hundred years of social and economic development, Neoclassicism emerges as another defining art movement. Jacques Louis David paints the Oath of the Horatii, a tribute to patriotism, brotherhood, and the triumph of classical values. After seeing this painting in 1784, one would conclude that moral and aesthetic values have been extremely consistent since the ages of classical antiquity. The desire to cling to the western delusion of rational thinking and sober order is persistent.",
        "But as modernity sets in, so do all of the things that come with it. The boom of capitalism and imperialism inspires the social response of revolution. People demand more from their governments. In a rapidly progressing age of technology and globalization, cultural continuity is revealed as a facsimile. The facade of a persistent, shared sense of cultural values deteriorates.",
        "Capitalists and white supremacists would like to label these events (social revolutions, riots, protests) as mere interruptions and inconveniences. They encourage gender roles within a nuclear family–a comfort in domesticity. They reinforce the inherent value of social norms and etiquette. Those that imagine a more equitable society are labeled as ungrateful, overly sensitive, and we are encouraged to take refuge in tradition and consumption. This is an easy way to live. Through our brief walkthrough of moments in western art history, we can see how pervasive and persistent these classical values are. Or, at least, how persistent the people that uphold them are. Especially for white, straight, gender-conforming individuals, why embrace interruption when this conformity is beneficial? Supporting the perseverance of these values is of interest to many.",
        "But The inherent superiority of these classical values is a lie. Even in the late 19th century, artists began resenting the limitations that came with the academy. They began recording the realities of the people. And now, art-making does not belong to a few highly trained, carefully selected individuals. With globalization came access. Artists are everywhere; art education is everywhere. Rather than appealing to a false sense of shared values, artists are leaning into interruption as a powerful tool.",
        "Artists deliberately create works that interfere with our social comforts. As a country we are comfortable with racism, genocide, colonialism. The artist can use interruption to jolt viewers into understanding alternate social realities and experiences. Interruption can be destabilizing, but it can be transformative as well. Artists may combine unlike senses or physical experiences. They may disorient common conceptual frameworks, or they might exaggerate form to convey new realities. Let’s look at some contemporary examples of interruption as artistic and social power.",
        "The wave of performance art in the 70s is one of the most glaring ages of interruption. It’s almost as if those artists were able to interrupt our literal humanity, to find holes and gaps in what we might have believed was an underlying empathy to our existence. In 1974, Marina Abramović laid out 72 items and stood completely still for six hours in a room full of eager audience members. The objects alone pose no threat, despite including razors, matches, and a pistol. Abramović said nothing to her audience members. She only provided a written broadcast: “I am the object. During this period I take full responsibility.” At first timid of the breathing and vulnerable woman at the front of the room, audience members soon shifted their perspective of Abramović to object. Viewers stripped her of her clothing, cut her, drank her blood, and eventually placed the loaded pistol to her chest. When she finally walked away at the end of the performance, audience members audibly gasped. They were harshly jolted into understanding a new reality. Abramović’s numerous performances have severely interrupted how we understand our relationship to art, women, and each other.",
        "As you’ll see in the following works, Knox students have continued the contemporary phenomenon of challenging social norms through disrupting the traditional art cannon. You will find ceramic vessels with supposedly no function at all, vessels that occupy the threshold between representation and abstraction. Students are not afraid to participate in the space between restrictive and oppressive binaries. There will be sculptural pieces that you might not have considered artworks had they not been featured in this journal. You will see various projects in design, theatre, sports. Knox students challenge the qualifications required to be deemed an “artwork,” making us then question the credentials we uphold for other classifications.",
        "When you’re looking at the following artworks, focus on the way a piece may interrupt your normal experience. Your visceral reaction to something says a lot about how you navigate the world. Let yourself be interrupted, let yourself be confused. If an interruption disturbs you, why? Sit with it. Maybe you will see something that you didn’t see before."

        "Found material fragments and nontraditional spaces have the ability to create new things that reclaim and reshape familiar themes. Cutting apart and reusing images can put them into new shape and context, creating originality out of familiar pieces. Putting symbols in a new context can entirely reshape their meanings and challenge old systems. Art based in reuse, like collage and assemblage, has historically been valued below traditional “high art” and excluded from art spaces. The forms are incredibly accessible, allowing creativity with little financial barrier as artistic sites and materials may be found all around. Collage sites span from quiet journal pages to public alleyways. Reclaimed art forms empower us to create through reusing what we have. The use of discarded materials and nontraditional space pushes the boundaries and allows disciplines to merge. Language merges with visual art in these additive forms, bridging gaps in mediums. The journal itself claims and adopts images and texts, bringing them together into newly created shared meaning.",
        "At the start of reclamation is the salvage of material. Reclamation of found materials in art opens up broad possibilities in visual creation, art accessibility, and perspectives on memory. The realization that our world is composed of art materials empowers us to use what’s around us to create. Artists who work in reclaimed forms often pull fragments from popular visual culture. Magazine cuttings, catalog scraps, and old newspapers become art materials, inviting familiar pop culture images into art. We can bring familiar visual elements into art through cutting and pasting printed ads, catalog pages, even pieces of books. Advertisements are a wealth of material to collage artists. Larger pop culture themes may be reappropriated in artistic works across a variety of mediums. Sydney Weisteich’s staged self portraits alter media tropes and character archetypes found in popular film and television to create emotionally and visually complex narratives. In the non-commercial realm, news clippings and historical items can preserve a piece of the past in contemporary art. A stack of scraps from an antique shop can spark an entire creative journey. These items call back to historical moments, emphasize notable events, and illustrate our recorded past. Reclaiming popular visual culture and fragments of history ensures that artwork is grounded in context.\nMaterials",
        "Other artists bring in the domestic archive of personally significant items, pulling directly from memory and lived experiences. The use of vulnerable personal items like clothing and letters in artwork can reclaim a personal narrative. It can be therapeutic to find materials in your life, utilizing personal scraps woven together with emotional sentiment. Utilizing scraps from my personal life in my art journals makes them more personal and associates my creative work with my material life. Saving scraps that are not meant to be saved preserves them in history, claiming our daily reality as the material of art. The resulting artworks are vulnerable and personal, inviting viewers to share and empathize. The use of ephemeral non-art materials, debris of everyday life, leaves a trace of bodily reality and lived experience in artwork.",
        "Collage and assemblage have traditionally worked with secondhand junk items and discarded materials considered trash. Popular contemporary artist Nick Cave works almost entirely in the realm of discarded objects to create his assemblages, finding familiarity and meaning in trash. The strategy forces messiness, a lack of marketability, a gap between collage and the traditional high art world. Jori Alexandria Pilcher’s untitled piece is a strong example of these strategies, weaving together discarded paper scraps and newspapers with foam and tape and canvases to create a solid structure. The piece carries the familiarity of the newspaper scraps, but the novelty of the newly combined form. Using messy discarded materials and further altering them creates unique and original compositions. The reuse of found materials is a subversive act, a reclamation of art in accessible material.",  
        "When materials and symbols are recontextualized in art, their meanings are changed and shifted into something unfamiliar. Materials hold some of the context they were taken from, leaving them with a sense of familiarity while they are reappropriated towards new meanings. Reclaimed materials express a delicate balance between old and new, familiar and original. In some works, the source materials remain visible and largely interpretable; in others, found material is taken apart into unrecognizable pieces. Tegan Springer’s Navigation alters and combines materials until they reach near-unrecognizable states of complexity, breaking them down into textural and tonal components of an entirely new image. Altered pieces of popular visual culture have unprecedented abilities to satirize their sources. Commercial images reclaimed in art take on new meanings and subvert consumerist expectations. The combination of repurposed consumer ad images with political statements has long held activist power as a way to communicate a progressive message to the viewer. Reclaimed artwork removes subjects from time, placing them in juxtaposition with new circumstances. Amelia Walz’s 1870’s Honsmaid Corset Recreation reconstructs a clothing garment, bringing this 1870s item into the modern age and altering it, forming questions of tradition and memory.\nMeaning",
        "Emotional association with imagery may shift when it is reclaimed in art, encouraging cultural perceptions to change. Subtle cultural themes may be exposed through reappropriations in art, bringing light to the harsh realities of life that evade the popular view and exposing viewers to complex perspectives. Sydney Weistrich’s Category 5 #girlmoment reworks archetypal tropes for female characters into a complex self-portrait that grapples with gender and violence. Minority artists may reclaim problematic source material in their work for reasons of cultural commentary and empowerment. Contemporary popular artists Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas, and Sara Cwynar reclaim historical Black images in their artwork, utilizing imagery which was frequently offensive in its original context to make new statements on racial identity. It’s a powerful way to maintain awareness and recognition for history while empowering people in the present. Giving materials a new life allows artists to rework the cultural meanings of symbols through their reclamation in art.",
        "Reclamation can also be defined in terms of the recultivation of damaged sites for positive means. Although it is often environmental, similar principles may be applied to artistic reclamation, taking spaces which have been harmed and using them as sites for new artworks. This is seen frequently with artists who work in graffiti, taking public space and turning it into a canvas. Popular sites are often abandoned or neglected, but given new attention by graffiti artists. Urvi Bohra’s Empty Zurich overlays images of Swedish buildings and scenery with graffiti tagging, commenting on public space. The phenomenon of stickering and graffiti in visual art exemplifies a movement of art reclaiming public spaces. It’s collaborative, additive, and full of reclamation of symbol and space. Urban areas become potential spaces for free creativity. Abandoned buildings have been similarly targeted for renovation and reconstruction by artists. In one groundbreaking historical project, the abandoned house used to create Womanhouse was physically reclaimed by a group of laboring artists who used the space as an artistic site.The merging reclamation of material, space, and symbol pushes artistic boundaries and encourages social progress.\nSpace",
        "Reclaimed art forms also allow us to inhabit sites with complex emotional associations and places we’ve been excluded from. Depicting or making art in emotionally charged sites can help us detangle our associations, conceiving new and healthier relationships with our environments. Lune Perkins’ Simple Beauty shows fleeting beauty in daily life in the home, turning the counter into a still-life site. A therapeutic series of works depicting the rural area I grew up in helped me to claim the spaces as my own despite challenging experiences. Feminist artists have often aimed to reclaim space for women through art, focusing on areas in which women have been traditionally suppressed or excluded. The artistic canvas is transformed to a site of activism, a space to voice criticisms of misogyny. Jori Alexandria Pilcher’s Out of Her Sense repeats the motif of a mannequin, an emblem of consumerist fashion, calling to mind the commodification of womens’ bodies in commercial spaces. Melina Minaya’s Melina Minaya collage juxtaposes gender symbols, creating a complex image of femininity projected into different surroundings. Frequently these artworks focus on the home, considering womens’ place in domestic familial environments. Martha Rosler used collaged images of the kitchen from popular magazines to create feminist statements on womens’ roles in society and the home. In reclaimed art, we can redefine our relationship to our surroundings.",
        "The mere presence of collage and assemblage pieces in museums represents a reclamation of high art space. The museum and gallery are spaces for marginalized artists to reclaim following historical exclusion. The art world has long devalued accessible forms. Collage and assemblage are democratized forms of art, highly financially accessible and integrated into public space. Bringing these into the space of high art brings marginalized artists into the spotlight and opens up questions about the boundaries of art. The inclusion of photography with discarded materials forces a gap between these forms and the realm of high art, while boldly entering traditional art spaces. Sydney Gillette’s So Sleepy combines a video of Gillette sleeping in their home with projected shifting images, questioning the divide between home and art space. Including these works in artistic exhibitions pushes the boundaries of high art spaces.\nArt and Culture",
        "Beyond the museum, found and reclaimed art has reached into the political sphere and the realm of the written word. Recontextualizing found fragments can weave counternarratives and define societal moments, blending political and artistic spheres. These reclaimed art forms have the ability to incite intense guilt and emotion, utilizing emotional responses to spark change. Jori Alexandria Pilcher’s Aborigine prompts considerations of racial issues through repeated text and a series of emotive faces. This piece also exemplifies the inclusion of written word in reclaimed art. The journal and art book, collaged forms of poetry, or zines can communicate a message through verbal collage strategies. Zo Peterson’s This Shirt is Made of Letters merges text with textile through the reuse of cutout letters to build a wearable item, turning them from elements of language into artistic clothing pieces. Found-media forms reach into public space, museums and galleries, the written page, and the political sphere to communicate their messages.",
        "Reclaimed art forms like collage carry power as an activist art strategy, allowing artists to move forward through the past, signifying a hopeful future. Whether these are utopian images set in contrast with reality, or fabricated unsettling futures intended to disturb and incite change, these artworks have strong emotional impact. Numerous contemporary artists utilize collage and assemblage methods to alter and reshape the material realm towards activist goals, supported by historical precedent of Dada activist artists and feminist artists. Artists seeking to make commentary on racial dynamics may cut and paste racial minority images into the historical narrative to pressure inclusion, or intentionally juxtapose the racism of the white Western narrative. Feminist artists can alter misogynistic historical images of women while reclaiming space for women. Visual culture representations materialize cultural conceptions of minority groups, and these artistic interventions pave a way for more empowered representation. Reclamation-based art in the public sphere can be a tool to stand against larger systematic suppression of minorities.\nFuture",
        "In the midst of political movements attempting to remove gender transition care, reproductive rights, and other bodily autonomy, these art forms claim our ability to alter and shape our own material reality. Using scraps of our daily lives, we can weave together empowering images. Working in reuse is a powerful tool against consumerism, resisting the need to spend money on materials and supporting recycling. Found-media art reaches into public space, supporting the recultivation of space for accessible artwork. The affordability and sustainability of reused art forms imbue them with high potential as artistic trends for the future. Sage Lundquist’s Hope Through All uses altered and manipulated image to create a bright and vivid abstract sense of hope for the future, despite challenges.",
        "Reclamation teaches us that the world around us is material for art, and that art can have a broad cultural reach. It’s not just reuse, but putting these everyday things into a new shape and context that allows us to claim material and space as something new. Written word, photography, and ephemera, are the basis of new artistic creations. Abandoned places and public space, reclaimed, become a canvas. And despite high-art’s devaluation of collage and assemblage, the forms strive forward into the museum space and the artistic canon. They have moved confidently into popular visual culture and the public consciousness, shaping the political realm. Art based in reclamation allows us to move forward through reshaping the things that we have. As discarded materials find new life, we are able to shift our past, present, and future into something reused but entirely new.\nConclusion",
